/*
 * Note that the parent theme's `style.css` file is automatically loaded.  Do *not* try to load it again 
 * with `@import`.
 *
 * The only custom CSS you really should add to your child theme is CSS to overwrite colors and fonts.  The 
 * things available to be overwritten are labeled as the "Fun Zone" in the Stargazer theme's `style.css` file. 
 * Just open it up and check it out.  Everything is clearly marked and commented so that you can understand 
 * what you're allowed to overwrite.
 *
 * To be perfectly honest, you could probably get away with not adding a single line of CSS code if you really 
 * go all out with some of the `functions.php` design options.
 *
 * Of course, use your best judgement with everything.  Have fun.  And, throw the rules out the window when 
 * justified.
 *
 * If you make custom color/font changes that change the output of things in the post content, you'll want to 
 * add those changes to a file called `editor-style.css` and place it within your child theme's `/css` folder. 
 * It will automatically be loaded for you when a user is writing via the visual editor.
